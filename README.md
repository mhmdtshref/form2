## Install

```bash
npm install --save form2
```

## Usage

The goal is to create a form without saving it's value in the component state. Let's start doing it. To benefit from this package, you have to replace the normal `form` html element with our new component `Form` that you can import it using:
```javascript
import { Form } from 'form2';
```
And you can create the form in the rendered JSX by, and add onSubmit action for it:
```typescript jsx
<Form onSubmit={(event) => { /* Use the form fields values by event.target.values */ }}>
    <!-- form fields should be implemented here too! -->
</Form>
```

To be able to get values inside onSubmit function, you have to use our components inside the components (and don't miss to import it with the `Form` component)
```typescript jsx
<Form onSubmit={(event) => { /* Use the form fields values by event.target.values */ }}>
    <TextField name="username" />
    <PasswordField name="password">
</Form>
```

and Let's combine everything in one component!

```javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Form, TextField, DatePicker } from 'form2';
import './App.css'

export default class TestComponent extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Form onSubmit={(event) => { /* Handle fields values by: typing `event.target.values` */ }}>
          <TextField name="username" />
          <TextField name="email" placeholder="Type correct email..." />
          <DatePicker name="birthday" />
         </Form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
